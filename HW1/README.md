**Goal:** Find the Regenerative Organizing Cell in the Frog tail (Figure 1, Panel B (Skin). Describe the data processing protocol that has allowed you to identify it. Find the genes that make this cell different from all other cells and compare this set of genes with the ones from Supplementary Table 3.

# Writeup Requirements:

- **Abstract:** A concise summary of your findings.
- **Introduction:** Brief background information on the problem 
- **Methods:** Detailed description of the data processing and analysis steps. Methods should have a section named Code Availability, containing a link to the public github account where the code is available.
- **Results:** Presentation of the clustering and gene analysis analysis. What did you find? It should include references to two figures, one summarizing the clustering results, the other one representing the gene expression analysis results (more information below)
- **Conclusion:** Summary of your findings
